// What is DOM ?
/*
  DOM is a global object representing html and content of a webpage.

  Using javascript we can change different part of webpage by interacting with document.

  (DOM stands for document object model)

  DOM is basically the representation of a web page that a javascript can use.

  DOM is basically a live entity , it means changing the DOM via javascript will alter the webpage.

  Soon we will understand how the javascript uses this tree like struture  and parent child relationship to alter the web pages .
