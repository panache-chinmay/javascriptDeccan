/* Loop through every element of array which is basically object of type student

  1) To loop through this , we should use bracket notation to loop through array.

  2)  use bracket notation to loop over array and then use . notation to get properties of
  every arrays.

  3) Add the javascript code to another js file , to keep data and functionality separately.
