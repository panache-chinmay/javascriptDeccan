// Objects and fucntions in javascript

// Advanced javascript objects and functions



// Every thing is an object : inheritance and prototype chain


// How javascrip handles object and inheritane through prototype


// Everything is a object

//primitives and objects


//primitives :-

// Numbers

// Strings

//Booleans

//Undefined

//Null

//------------------------------------------------------------>

// Everthing else  is an object

// Arrays

// Functions

// Objects

// Dates

// Wrappers for Numbers ,Strings and Strings and Booleans

// Object oreinted programming in javascript


// Object interacting through one another with help of properties and methods

// Used to store data ,structure applications into modules and keeping code clean .

// So far we had created simple object having data .

// something as blue print so we can generate many objects as we can ---->

// Now comes the use of type script .


// Constructors and instructors in javascript


//constructor will be person from which we will create many instances

//var jane
//var mark
//var  john

//constructor is blue print from which we can create many instances :-

//instances means object



// 2nd concept inheritance ..

// Inheritance is the one in which one object is based on the another object

// Inheritance in javascript prototypes and prototypeschain

// Each and every javascript object has a prototype property which makes Inheritance
//possible in JavaScript


// EACH AND EVERY JAVASCRIPT FILE HAS PROTOTYPE PROPERTY
//
// INHERITANCE IS MADE POSSIBLE IN JAVSCRIPT VIA PROTOTYPE PROPERTY OF EVERY OBJECT
//
// // PROTYPE PROPERTY OF A OBJECT IS WHERE wE WILL PUT OUR PROPERTIES AND METHODS SO THE
// // OTHER OBJECT CAN INHERIT
//
// PERSON(BLUE PRINT PROTOTYPE PROPERTY) IS NOT THE PROPERTY OF THE PERSON ITSELF
//
// PERSON PROTOTYPE PERSON IS THE PROPERTY OF JOHN

// EACH OBJECT WE CREATE IS A PROPERTY OF OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR


// We have to add person properties to its  prototype property  for inheritance



//Summary

//Every javascript has a prototype property , which makes  inheritance possible in javascript.

//The proptype property of a object where we put methods and properties that we want other object to
//inherit.

// The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself , its the prototype
//of All instances that are created through it ..

// When a certain method or property is called ,the search starts in the object itself , and if it cannot be found
//, the search moves to the object's prototype ..This continuos until the method is found: prototype changing
