// Generating random numbers in javascript -

// You create random number in javascript using Math Objects

// There are various types of objects in javascript


//Number is one type of object

// String is also object in javascript

// Every object will have properties and methods


For example - Every string has property of length

// Math is another type of object in java-script

// Round method is used to round off values

// Math.floor() will round the number to floor -> 6.57 --> 6

// Math.Ceil() will round the number to ceil -> 6.89 --> 7

// Math.random() will give the values between 0 and 1

// If you want random number between 0 and 6

// Math.random()*6

// If you want to get number between one and six

// In terms of programming the code runs inside out .. code inside the round bracker ()
// will run First


// Making decisions with conditional statements

// / Introducing conditional statements

// You can add the behavior  of a programmer by adding decision making to it

// for example --> score game

// / Comparison operator  // / Building a random number guessing game

// Code inside the curly braces is know as code block

// We can have block of code if condition is true

// We also can have block of code if condition is false

// A program quiz ...ruby with upper letter , ruby with lower letter and with Camel Case

// All the conditions condition statement basically ends with yes or no -->

in programming terminology (True or false)

//  / Boolean values

// true and false specifies a set of value called as boolean value

// We can assign a boolean value to variable

// / Programming multiple outcomes


if /else if /else

// / Documents code with comments

 Types of comments

 Single line comment

 Multiline comment

 Comments are useful for keeping the block of code not in use currently

 Comments helps to understand the code when you come back to same code after years


Single line comment --> // This is single line comment

Multi line comment --> // This is multi-line comment


// / combining multiple steps into a single conditions

 && --> && operator to evaluate both condition are true

 || --> || operator to evaluate either one of condition is true


  No restriction on number of && or OR operator per expression

// / Coding challenge --> the quiz challenge

// / The quiz challenge solution

// --->  if the 'if' condition is satisfied the block inside the  if condition will
be executed irrespective of else if condition evaluated to be true .
