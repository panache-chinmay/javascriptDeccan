2  About javascript

A programming   language's command , special words and punctuation is called syntax
programming concept -> Strings , Vars , Functions and OOps concept  ----> which will be applicable to all concepts
Javascript is not java.


3. First Javascript program

alert("Welcome to Javascript")


4 . Where does the javascript goes

// Browser performs lots of different function

//screenshotOne.png

// Every browser has javascript interpretor which reads the instructions when the
browser invokes javascript programme

// interpretor looks for the each statement in the programme and execute the same ..
means do what is intended to do

When the browser follows the instruction in a program  , it runs or execute that program
// Its basically a common practice to place your code in separate javascript file
// Script tag to add the external js file --> src is the attribute with file path as value
// Its perfectly ok to have more than one script tag on html page
// Placing the javascript at bottom of page lets the html load first and then javascript function executes

5. Javascript console

// One typo and most of your programme breaks
// All javascript broswer have javacript console , which will list the errors in javascript file.
// Programme syntax is its vocabulary and error
// Unexpected indentifier ..many things can cause those error
// Uncaught TypeError : undefined is not a function
// Programming will always have a pair of quote marks
// Opening quote mark and closing quote marks

// Incase of many syntax errors the console will always show the first syntax error
// console.log helps the user to identify where our program is heading

// Now you know the three different ways to output your messages

alert("") ;/ document.write("");/console.log();


6. The console.log challenge

// /Introducing variable

// Storing and tracking information with variables

variables -> score is a example of variables

//example of box for variable


var --> keyword creates box -- scores ---name of box  ---- equal to sign to insert value into variable

// what is at right will be assigned to left

// Quote marks around variable will make it String

// We can overwrite the value of the variables --> for second time we don't need to use var variable

//  /Naming convention for variables


// Javascript have a list of reserved keyword

// You can't create a variable named var ----> syntax error


// variable  names does not start with number  9lives (incorrect)

// names can only content  letters , numbers , $ , _

//common convention is to add variable name with more than one word using _ or CamelCase

// price_per_unit  or pricePerUnit


// / Strings and Numbers


We store values in variables --> The basic two types of values are 1) Numbers 2) Strings

// Numbers can be basically used for calculations

// Strings can be used for words , sentences and other text

// String is nothing but the set of characters in the quote mark

// String starting with single quote ends with single quote

// String starting with double quote ends in double quote

// If you want single quote in string use double quote

// If you want single quote in string use single quote



//  /Spaces ,Tabs and newline in Javascript


// As Html and Css , Javascript does not care much about the spaces

we can add spaces before and after the statement

// Use spaces to make your code easily understandable and readable

// A space a either side of = (equalTo) makes it easier to read

// You cannot add space in middle of variable name


// / capturing  userInput  in javascript  --> javascript five

// capturing user input can be done with prompt variable


// / Combining Strings  in  javascript


// Combining string together is know as Concatenation in javascript

// Stuff on the write goes into the left

// We can concatenate string using + operator

// A variable may be defined as placeholder for a string .

// How to add string to the variable


// / working with String and finding help ..


// Best resources for javascript developer

// Mozilla Developer network

// Object will have properties

// How to find the length of the string ..?

// To test whether user had set a password , which is six character long

// why is the . inside  message.length (message is object and property is length )

// Length property will return the number of character of string

// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

// Method is something you can do with object

// Property is something that an object possess

// String.prototype basically refers to string

// String.prototype.toLowerCase() makes the string to LowerCase

// String.prototype.toUpperCase() makes the string to UpperCase


// Objects


A string , the document , the browser console

Objects  have properties , such as the length of string

Objects have methods , which are actions the actions object can performs
